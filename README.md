Introduction:
I am a let's say amateur programmer that decided to share his suffering.

I have an interest in programming and eletronics, as in mainly embedded systems.

Currently Im sitting on half a decade of programming experience working on multiple personal projects and some even reached the barely working state.

Can't think of anything else.
